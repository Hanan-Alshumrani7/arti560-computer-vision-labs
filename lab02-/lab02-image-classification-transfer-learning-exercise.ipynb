    "In this exercise, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select another pretrained model (e.g., VGG16, MobileNetV2, or EfficientNet) and fine-tune it for CIFAR-10 classification.  \n",
    "You'll find the models in [Tensorflow Keras Application Module](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications).\n",

    "2. Before training, inspect the architecture using `model.summary()` and observe:\n",
